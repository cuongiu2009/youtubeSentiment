# Implementation Plan: Sentiment Analysis for a Specific YouTube Video

**Branch**: `feature/1-sentiment-analysis` | **Date**: 2025-09-25 | **Spec**: [specs/1-sentiment-analysis/spec.md](specs/1-sentiment-analysis/spec.md)

## Summary
The primary goal is to build a web application that accepts a YouTube URL, fetches video details and comments using the YouTube API, performs Speech-to-Text on the video's audio to generate a summary, runs sentiment analysis on the comments, and displays a consolidated report.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: 
- Web Framework: FastAPI
- YouTube API Client: `google-api-python-client`
- Speech-to-Text: YouTube Transcript API / `openai-whisper` (fallback)
- Audio Downloader: `pytube`
- Sentiment Analysis: [NEEDS RESEARCH] (from Hugging Face)
**Storage**: N/A (stateless for now)
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Web Browser
**Project Type**: Web Application
**Performance Goals**: Process requests within a reasonable time, with clear feedback to the user during long operations.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research.*

- **I. Code Quality**: All code will be written to be clean, maintainable, and will be linted.
- **II. Testing Standards**: Unit and integration tests will be created with `pytest` to ensure at least 80% coverage.
- **III. User Experience Consistency**: The web interface will be simple and consistent.
- **IV. Performance Requirements**: The application will be designed to be responsive, with performance benchmarks for the analysis pipeline.

## Project Structure
**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application (backend/frontend)

```
backend/
├── src/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── services/
│   └── api/
└── tests/

frontend/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   └── services/
└── tests/
```

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
Research tasks are defined in `research.md`. The goal is to decide on the specific libraries for Speech-to-Text and sentiment analysis.

**Output**: `research.md` with all [NEEDS RESEARCH] items resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Data Model**: Define the data structures for `Video` and `Comment` in `data-model.md`.
2. **API Contracts**: Define the API endpoint(s) in `contracts/`. A single endpoint that accepts a URL and returns the analysis report will be sufficient.
3. **Test Scenarios**: Define integration test scenarios in `quickstart.md`.

**Output**: `data-model.md`, `/contracts/*`, `quickstart.md`

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [ ] Phase 0: Research complete
- [ ] Phase 1: Design complete
