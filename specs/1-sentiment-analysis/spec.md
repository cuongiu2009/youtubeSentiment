## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: For the initial version, what level of video content analysis should be implemented? ‚Üí A: Text-Based Analysis: Use a Speech-to-Text service to get a transcript of the video.
- Q: How should the system behave if a YouTube video has its comments disabled? ‚Üí A: Show an Error Message: Display a clear message like "This video has comments disabled, so sentiment analysis is not possible." and stop processing.
- Q: To manage costs and processing time, how should we handle videos with a very large number of comments? ‚Üí A: User-Selectable Limit: Allow the user to choose how many comments to analyze from predefined tiers.
- Q: What should happen if the YouTube API is unavailable or returns an error during the process? ‚Üí A: Display a Generic Error: Show a simple, non-technical error message like, "Could not connect to YouTube. Please try again later."
